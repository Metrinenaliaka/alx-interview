*For the “0. Island Perimeter” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.*

### Concepts Needed:
1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):

   - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
   - Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
2. Conditional Logic:

   - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
3. Counting Techniques:

   - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.
4. Problem-Solving Strategies:

   - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
5. Python Programming:

   - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
   - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
